AWSnap!
=======
Ever felt like AWS libraries do to much? Like they wrap your workflow in lots of request processing, response handling and other gunk? AWSnap cuts to the chase: just give it an AWS API endpoint and some params, and it'll spit out a signed URI. You take it from there.

Ever felt like AWS libraries don't do enough? They make it easy to do S3, Cloudfront, maybe some SQS. But if you wander off the path, you're on your own. AWSnap has your back: integrate any AWS API on your own, and sign requests with AWSnap.

Examples
--------
    request = Awsnap::Request.new("https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/", 
                :get, 
                {"Action" => "ListQueues", 
                 "Version" => "2009-02-01", 
                 :access_key_id => <Your-Access-Key-ID>, 
                 :secret_access_key => <Your-Secret-Access-Key>, 
                 :expires => 10.minutes.from_now}
                )

    request.to_s 
    #=> "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/?AWSAccessKeyId=Your-Access-Key-ID&Action=ListQueues&Expires=2011-06-15T10%3A21%3A27-07%3A00&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Version=2009-02-01&Signature=CrazySignatureMadnessHere"
